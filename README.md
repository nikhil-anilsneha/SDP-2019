NZ Travel is a mobile application created using Xamarin Forms that allows you to plan a journey by adding attractions, restaurants and fuel stations to an itinerary which can then be shared via email or other sharing applications. At present this application works on Android devices but can be developed to work on iOS devices as well due to the cross-platform nature of Xamarin. The features of the app are further detailed below:

MAP:
The map tab can be used to view your current location and can also be used to search for attractions. Once an attraction has been located on the map, the Directions feature of Google Maps can be used to find directions from your current location to the searched location.

FUEL:
The fuel tab can be used to view fuel stations nearest to your current location. Details about the fuel station like opening hours, phone numbers and address can be viewed. A selected fuel station can be added to an existing itinerary and can also be opened up in Google Maps on the device

ATTRACTIONS:
The attractions tab can be used to view attractions in your current region and also in other regions of New Zealand. Like with the fuel tab, details about an attraction like opening hours, phone numbers, address, website and phone numbers can be viewed. A selected attraction can be added to an existing itinerary and can also be opened up in Google Maps on the device.

RESTAURANTS:
The restaurants tab can be used to view restaurants nearest to your current location. Details about the restaurant like opening hours, phone numbers and address can be viewed. A selected restaurant can be added to an existing itinerary and can also be opened up in Google Maps on the device.

ITINERARY:
The itinerary tab can be used to create new itineraries and attractions can be added to a selected itinerary. Details about an item in the itinerary like the time and date selected can be viewed and these details can also be edited. An item can also be opened up in Google Maps so that directions to the item are visible.

EMERGENCY:
The emergency tab shows the contact details of various emergency contacts such as police, ambulance fire, minor traffic incidents and AA Roadside Service Assistance and clicking on these contacts opens them up in the device's phone application.
